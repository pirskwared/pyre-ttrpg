# Expansion Points (XP)

A character can spend XP to train, which can be used to increase an attribute, acquire a feature, or increase the training bonus to a statistic or a skill.

Characters cannot normally spend XP to change their Size.

## Training

Training normally takes 1 day per 10 XP spent.

Training can be shortened by magic, hiring a trainer, or training with another character who already possesses the score, feature, or bonus being trained.

Training time is shortened at GM discretion.

## XP Cost

To determine XP cost, you determine a base cost, and multiply by the multiplier to get a total XP cost.

| Improvement | Cost | Multiplier |
|-|-|-|
| Attribute | Current score + 1 | x 100 |
| Feature | Current number of features + 1 | x 60 |
| Statistic | Current training bonus + 1 | x 30 |
| Skill | Current training bonus + 1 | x 10 |

You must purchase each increase individually.

For example, if you wanted to boost Strength from 11 to 13, you would first buy from 11 to 12, then from 12 to 13.

| 20 | 21 000 | | | | | | |
| 21 | 23 100 | | | | | | |
