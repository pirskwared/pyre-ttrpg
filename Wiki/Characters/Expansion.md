# Expansion Point (XP)

A character can spend XP to purchase new abilities or boost attributes, skills, and statistics

Characters cannot normally spend XP to change their Size.

## XP Cost

To determine XP cost, you determine a base cost, and multiply by the multiplier to get a total XP cost.

| Improvement | Cost | Multiplier |
|-|-|-|
| Attribute | Current score + 1 | x 100 |
| Feature | Current number of features + 1 | x 60 |
| Statistic | Current bonus + 1 | x 30 |
| Skill | Current bonus + 1 | x 10 |

You must purchase each increase individually.

For example, if you wanted to boost Strength from 11 to 13, you would first buy from 11 to 12, then from 12 to 13.
