# Character Creation

## Expansion

Your GM determines the amount of [Expansion Points (XP)](/Wiki/Characters/Expansion.md) you start with.

100 XP is recommended.

## Choose a Species

See [Species](/Species).

The GM determines the list of available species.

Some species cost XP, while others have a negative cost, so you gain XP instead.

## Assign Attributes and Size

To boost your attributes, you get a pool of numbers, and you assign those numbers to attribute slots. You must fill each slot with at least one number.

Your starting maximum value for each attribute is the sum of the numbers in each attribute's slot, plus any species modifiers.

It is recommended that players begin with four 6s, four 5s, four 4s, four 3s, four 2s, and four 1s.

Optionally, you could have players [purchase their attributes with XP](/Wiki/Characters/Expansion.md), and allow them to choose any size within their species' minimum and maximum. If you do so, raise their starting XP by 20 000.

### Example Assignment

An example [Human](/Species/Human) attribute assignment.

| Dice Pool | | | | | | |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|  | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
|  | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
|  | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
|  | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |

We know we want to be size 10, so we apply one of the 4s to Size.

Next, we want a good STR, so we assign two of the 6s to STR, and the remaining two 6s to DEX and CON.


| Attribute | Base | Slot 1 | Slot 2 | Slot 3 | Total |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Strength (STR) | 0 | 6 | 6 | 4 | 16 (+6) |
| Dexterity (DEX) | 0 | 6 | 3 | 3 | 12 (+2) |
| Constitution (CON) | 0 | 6 | 4 | 4 | 14 (+4) |
| Intelligence (INT) | 0 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 13 (+3) |
| Wisdom (WIS) | 0 | 5 | 5 | 2 | 12 (+2) |
| Charm (CHA) | 0 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 7 (-3) |
| Size (SIZ) | 6 | 4 | - | - | 10 (+0)|

## Equipment

Your GM determines your starting wealth.

It is recommended to allow players to spend 1 XP on each gold piece they would like to start the game with.
