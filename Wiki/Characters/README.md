# Character Creation

## Expansion

Your GM determines the amount of [Expansion Points (XP)](/Rules/CharacterExpansion.md) you start with.

100 XP is recommended.

## Choose a Species

See [Species](/Species).

The GM determines the list of available species.

Some species cost XP, while others have a negative cost, so you gain XP instead.

## Assign Attributes and Size

To boost your attributes, you get a pool of numbers, and you assign those numbers to attribute slots. You must fill each slot with at least one number.

Your starting maximum value for each attribute is the sum of the numbers in each attribute's slot, plus any species modifiers.

Each creature starts with one 6, one 5, one 4, one 3, one 2, and one 1 in their pool.

For every 6 slots you have, you add an additional 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 to your pool.

If you have a remainder, you may also add that number to your pool as well. For example, if you have 19 slots, you add an additional 1 to your pool.
