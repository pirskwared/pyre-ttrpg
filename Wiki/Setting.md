# Setting

The world of Pyre is intended to be shrouded in mystery, a mixture of post apocalypse and high fantasy.

Great empires lay fallen, and ancient magics lay waiting to be rediscovered.

Civilizations are haunted by constant danger, and travelling even short distance warrants substantial guard.

However, Pyre is not necessarily one specific setting.

Pyre sets a general tone and provides rules while the Game Master provides specific geography and narrative.

Essentially, Pyre is a homebrew game.
