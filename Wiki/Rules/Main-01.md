# Basic Rules

Pyre is played like any other tabletop RPG.

The world of Pyre is intended to be shrouded in mystery, a mixture of post apocalypse and high fantasy.

Great empires lay fallen, and ancient magics lay waiting to be rediscovered.

Civilizations are haunted by constant danger, and travelling even short distance warrants substantial guard.

However, Pyre is not necessarily one specific setting.

Pyre sets a general tone and provides rules while the Game Master provides specific geography and narrative.

## Time

Time is divided into 6-second rounds, during which each creature gets 6 Action Points.

| Time | Rounds |
|-|-|
| 1 min | 10 |
| 5 min | 50 |
| 10 min | 100 |
| 1 hr | 600 |
| 8 hr | 4 800 |
| 24 hr | 14 400 |

Out of combat, it is assumed all creatures use 3 AP per round, as using more AP requires [Exertion](/Rules/Exertion).

Out of combat, creatures can use [Long Term Actions])/Rules/Actions/LongTerm)

## Space

Space is measured in feet, and movement speed is measured in feet per 2 AP, or per 2 seconds.

[Overland Travel])/Rules/Actions/LongTerm/OverlandTravel) is a long-term action.

## Size

Size is measured by the object or creauture's longest dimension.

If an obejct or creature would impact another, its damage is generally 1d6 force damage per 5 points of Size

Some may count as bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing, depending on the object, at GM discretion.

For example, a sharp object might do slashing, or plate armor on a creature might do bludgeoning.

| Size | Length |
|-|-|
| 1 | |
| 10 | 6 ft |
| 11 | 7 ft |
| 12 | 8 ft |
| 13 | 9 ft |
| 14 | 10 ft |

## Gravity

Falling damage is generally 1d6 force damage plus 1d6 force damage per 5 feet fallen.

## Force

Force damage is its own damage type.

If the same source that did bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage does force damage, that force damage may be converted to that damage type.

## Throwing Objects

To Throw an object or creature, test STR + SIZ against it's size.

The oject must be held and not be contested, or the creature must be [Grabbed] and [Picked Up].

On success, it is thrown up to a number of squares equal to how much the test succeeded by.

It takes 1 damage from landing.

On failure, test again, but not to throw it. On success, it is not dropped, but on failure, it is dropped.

Dropped items fall 1 foot plus 1 foot per 5 Size of the creature that dropped it.

## Collision

Two objects that collide take damage.

1 point of damage is equivalent to an amount of injury that a human could heal after 8 hours of sleep.

Damage for objects is the same amount of force, however,
