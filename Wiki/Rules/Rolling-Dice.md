# Rolling Dice

In Pyre, the outcome of game events is determined by rolling dice and adding appropriate modifiers.

## Modifiers

A modifier refers to any number, positive or negative, that is used for skills, attributes, etc.

A penalty is any negative modifier, including effects that divide (e.g. x1/2, x0.75, etc).

A bonus is any positive modifier, including effects that multiply by more than 1 (e.g. x2, x3, etc).

## Tests

Most rolls in Pyre are called "tests".

To roll a test, roll a d20 and add any relevant modifiers.

For example, to roll a Climb test, you would roll a d20 and add DEX modifier and Climb skill modifier (also add STR bonus if you have the Power Climb feature).

The total sum is called the Result.

The GM compares the result to the relevant Difficulty number.

| Challenge | Difficulty |
|-|-|
| Trivial | 0 |
| Easy | 5 |
| Average | 10 |
| Above Average | 15 |
| Hard | 20 |
| Very Hard | 25 |
| Expert | 30 |

Some skills have difficulty numbers that are more specific, see [Skills](/Skills.md) more more info.

### Criticals

Most, but not all tests use critical rules.

If the d20 rolls a natural 20, the test automatically succeeds, regardless of result. You succeed by a minimum of 1.

If the d20 rolls a natural 1, the test automatically fails, and you fail by a minimum of 1.
