# Assign Attributes

To boost your attributes, you get a pool of numbers, and you assign those numbers to attribute slots. 

Your starting maximum value for each attribute is the sum of the numbers in each attribute's slot, plus any species modifiers.

Each creature starts with one 6, one 5, one 4, one 3, one 2, and one 1 in their pool.

For every 6 slots you have, you add an additional 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 to your pool.

If you have a remainder, you may also add that number to your pool as well.

#### Example Assignment

[Humans](/Species/Human) start with the stats for [Living Creatures](/Species/Types/Living).

| Attribute | Slot 1 | Slot 2 | Slot 3 | Total |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| SIZ | (6) | 4 | - | 10 |
| CON | 6 | 4 | 4 | 14 |
| DEX | 6 | 3 | 3 | 12 |
| STR | 6 | 6 | 4 | 16 |
| CHA | 2 | 3 | 3 | 8 |
| INT | 5 | 5 | 2 | 12 |
| WIS | 5 | 5 | 2 | 12 |

# Expansion

Your GM determines the amount of XP you start with. 10 to 20 XP is recommended.

See [Character Expansion](/Rules/CharacterExpansion.md)

# Backstory

Your character can have any backstory you like, and it is recommended that you spend your starting XP on abilities that align with your backstory.

# Equipment

Your GM determines your starting wealth, but it is recommended to simply allow players to spend 1 XP on each gold piece they would like to start the game with.

The equipment and wealth you start with can have any backstory you like. For example, starting with 10 gp or more might indicate noble birth, or a rich benefactor. Alternatively, if you chooses to purchase a large asset at character creation, perhaps a magic item or expensive equipment, it might be a family heirloom or inheritance rather than a simple purchase.
